placing app.psgi or dancerREST.pl under bin/ directory does not 
work correctly. I don't know why !!!

plackup -a app.psgi

and then 

curl -H "Content-Type: application/json" -X GET http:r/1ocalhost:5000/api/user

returns 

{"error":"unknown user"}

the main calling program needs to be placed in the root folder.

now ..plackup -a bin/app.psgi
and same curl statement returns

An internal error occured
